NAME
    capp_lint.py -- check formatting of Objective-J files

SYNOPSIS
    capp_lint.py [options] [file ... | -]

DESCRIPTION
    capp_lint.py is a formatting checker for Objective-J. It performs a number of checks that catch
    common formatting mistakes, as defined in the Cappuccino coding style guidelines
    (http://cappuccino.org/contribute/coding-style.php).

    capp_lint.py operates on a list of files. You may pass one or more filenames (relative to the
    current working directory) as arguments to capp_lint.py, or if the first filename is "-", the
    list of filenames is taken from stdin, in which case everything after the "-" is ignored.

    The following options are available:

    -v/--verbose
        Displays each line as it is processed by capp_lint.py with a line number,
        along with some information about syntactic information it finds.

    -q/--quiet
        Normally capp_lint.py will print a list of the errors it finds. If this option is passed,
        the error list is suppressed. This option is mutually exclusive with the -v option.

    -h/--help
        Shows a synopsis of the usage and options and exits.

    The following formatting errors are flagged by capp_lint.py:

    - Lines which contain one or more tabs.
    - Missing space between control statements and their opening parentheses.
    - Trailing whitespace.
    - Binary operators without surrounding space.
    - Assignment operators without surrounding space.
    - Comparison operators without surrounding space.
    - Useless unary + operators.
    - Extra or missing space in a method declaration.
    - Superflous function names.
    - Unterminated variable blocks.
    - Consecutive var statements.
    - Incorrect indentation in a var block.
    - Missing statement separators in a var block.
    - Inadvertent global variables in a var block.
    - Unbalanced [, { or ( in a variable block.

EXIT STATUS
    If capp_lint.py exits with a return status of one if it finds any errors. If no errors are found,
    it exits with a return status of zero.

OUTPUT
    For each error that capp_lint.py finds, if the -q/--quiet option was not passed, capp_lint.py
    will output an error like the following:

    AppKit/CPObjectController.j:482: assignment operator without surrounding spaces.
    +    for (var i=0, count=[_observationProxies count]; i<count; i++)
                   ^        ^

    The filename (relative to the working directory), line number, and type of error are displayed
    first, followed by the offending line of source code. When possible and necessary (as in this example),
    the location of the errors is indicated below the source line.
